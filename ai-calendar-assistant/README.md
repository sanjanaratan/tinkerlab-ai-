This was honestly such a fun little project. I built a smart calendar assistant that books meetings for me using just a chat message. No intense coding involved — just smart tools and creative workflow thinking.

I used **n8n** to build the entire workflow, plugged in **OpenAI's Chat Model** to understand natural text like “book a meeting for tomorrow at 10am,” and connected **Google Calendar** to actually schedule the event.

It all starts with a simple chat. The AI figures out the intent, checks my calendar availability, and sets the event if I’m free. It feels like magic, but once I got the hang of how to connect everything, it turned out to be surprisingly easy.

This was part of a learning series by **NextWork**, and I’m genuinely grateful for it. I’m still a beginner exploring the world of AI workflows and this gave me such a solid and fun head start. I ran into a few bugs, mostly around how time and dates are handled, but figuring those out made it all the more rewarding.

Definitely one of those _this is "why I love tech"_ moments.
