âš¡ Turning AI ideas into fun, practical workflows using just curiosity and creativity â€” no heavy code needed.

Hey there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to tinkerlab ai, my personal lab where I explore AI and automation in a hands-on, creative way.

Iâ€™ve always been passionate about AI and the amazing things it can do. But Iâ€™ve also realized that building smart systems doesnâ€™t always need to involve thousands of lines of code. This space is where I mix both coding and non-coding AI experiments â€” from tools like n8n and ChatGPT to workflows that connect AI with real-world apps.

Think of it as my growing collection of projects where I learn, build, break things, fix them, and enjoy the process. Each one is a step toward building real, usable systems with real-world impact.

If you're into AI workflows, smart assistants, or just want to see how AI can be brought to life in surprisingly simple ways, feel free to explore, fork, or follow along.

A special shoutout to **NextWork** â€” some of the work here has been inspired by their projects and resources. Iâ€™m still early in my journey with AI workflows, and their structured guidance has helped me learn how to build and experiment with confidence. This repo marks the start of many fun experiments ahead.
